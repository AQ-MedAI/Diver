{"id": "0", "query": "Claim in article about why insects are attracted to light\nIn this article they are addressing the reason insects are attracted to light when they say\nHeat radiation as an attractive component is refuted by the effect of LED lighting, which supplies negligible infrared radiation yet still entraps vast numbers of insects.\nI don't see why attraction to LEDs shows they're not seeking heat. Could they for example be evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat? So that even though they don't encounter heat near/on the LEDs they still \"expect\" to?\n\n\nThe question of why insects are attracted to light, particularly in the context of LED lighting, which emits little to no infrared radiation, is intriguing. The passage suggests that the attraction to LEDs does not necessarily indicate a pursuit of heat but could instead reflect an evolutionary association between light and heat. Insects may have evolved to associate light with heat sources, such as the sun, even if the light itself does not emit significant heat. This evolutionary programming might explain why insects are still drawn to light, even when the heat component is negligible.\n\nInsects have complex visual systems that allow them to detect a wide range of light wavelengths, including ultraviolet (UV) and infrared, which are often associated with heat sources. For example, many insects can perceive UV light, which is abundant in sunlight, and may have evolved to use UV as a cue for locating warm, sunlit areas. LEDs, which emit light in specific wavelengths (e.g., blue, green, or UV), may mimic these cues, attracting insects even though they lack the heat associated with natural light sources.\n\nThe idea that insects are \"programmed\" to expect heat when they encounter light aligns with their evolutionary history. Over millions of years, insects have likely developed phototactic behaviors that link light exposure to beneficial environments, such as warmth and food sources. This association may persist even when the light source no longer provides heat, as is the case with LEDs. Thus, the attraction to LEDs could be a byproduct of this deeply ingrained survival mechanism.\n\nInsects are primarily attracted to light due to a phenomenon known as phototaxis, an evolutionary behavior that guides them toward light sources. This attraction is not driven by heat but by an instinctual response linked to beneficial environments. Historically, light, particularly from the sun, has indicated warmth and safety, essential for survival and reproduction. Insects have evolved photoreceptors sensitive to specific light wavelengths, including UV, green, and blue, which are associated with natural light sources. LEDs, emitting these wavelengths without significant heat, still attract insects because they mimic the beneficial conditions insects are programmed to seek. Thus, the attraction is rooted in evolutionary adaptation to light as a cue for a favorable habitat, rather than the presence of heat."}

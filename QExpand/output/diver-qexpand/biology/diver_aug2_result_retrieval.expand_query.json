{"id": "0", "query": "Claim in article about why insects are attracted to light\nIn this article they are addressing the reason insects are attracted to light when they say\nHeat radiation as an attractive component is refuted by the effect of LED lighting, which supplies negligible infrared radiation yet still entraps vast numbers of insects.\nI don't see why attraction to LEDs shows they're not seeking heat. Could they for example be evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat? So that even though they don't encounter heat near/on the LEDs they still \"expect\" to?\n\n\nInsects are primarily attracted to light due to a phenomenon known as phototaxis, an evolutionary behavior that guides them toward light sources. This attraction is not driven by heat but by an instinctual response linked to beneficial environments. Historically, light, particularly from the sun, has indicated warmth and safety, essential for survival and reproduction. Insects have evolved photoreceptors sensitive to specific light wavelengths, including UV, green, and blue, which are associated with natural light sources. LEDs, emitting these wavelengths without significant heat, still attract insects because they mimic the beneficial conditions insects are programmed to seek. Thus, the attraction is rooted in evolutionary adaptation to light as a cue for a favorable habitat, rather than the presence of heat.\n\nInsects are attracted to light primarily due to a phenomenon called phototaxis, an evolutionary behavior that guides them toward light sources.

The absence of heat from LEDs does not deter insects because their attraction is rooted in evolutionary adaptation to light as a cue for a favorable habitat. Over time, insects have developed a response to light cues that historically indicated warmth and safety. Thus, the light itself, not the presence of heat, triggers the same response, as it is a reliable indicator of a safe, warm environment where they can function optimally. This evolutionary link explains why insects are attracted to light sources like LEDs, which provide the necessary wavelengths without heat."}

In 1810, the Republic of West Florida (including Mississippi coastal counties) became U.S. land. Later, Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian lands were added to the territory. This U.S. flag also waved in 1817, as Mississippi was admitted as the 20th U.S. state.\n\n[2]. Racine County, Wisconsin. Racine County, WI is located between Elkhorn and Lake Michigan in the north center part of the state along the only great lakes entirely in the United States of America.\n\n[3]. The Territory of Michigan was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from June 30, 1805, until January 26, 1837, when the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Michigan. Detroit was the territorial capital.he region that became Michigan was initially unorganized territory, and remained under British control until 1796; that did not stop Governor Arthur St. Clair from establishing a structure of government for the area, if only on paper.\n\n[4]. After Missouri's admission to the Union in 1821, no other states were admitted until 1836 when Arkansas became a slave state, followed by Michigan in 1837 as a free state. Indeed, the debate over slave and free states remained relatively calm for almost 30 years. However by the late 1840s, several events occurred that upset the balance: the U.S. added new territory as a result of the Mexican war, and the question of whether that territory would be slave or free arose again.\n\n[5]. Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the Indian trails. The original Shore Trail ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US 23 from the Bay City area to Cheboygan. Another section of the current highway followed the Saginaw Trail between Flint and Saginaw.\n\n[6]. Minnesota Became the 32nd State May 11, 1858. Despite the convenient access to the state, immigration was slow until the second half of the 19th century, when people in the east started to hear about Minnesota's woodlands and fertile prairie.\n\n[7]. The climate of Lansing (Michigan - United States of America) Lansing is located in the southern part of the state of Michigan and is the capital of this state. Lansing is known for the many educational institutes that can be found in the city. Because of this the population of Lansing is the best educated in the United States.\n\n[8]. Midwestern United States. The Midwestern United States (or Midwest) is a name for the north-central states of the United States of America. The states that are part of the Midwest are: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The word Midwest has been in common use since the late 19th century.\n\n[9]. The history of Missouri begins with settlement of the region by indigenous people during the Paleo-Indian period beginning in about 12,000 BC. Subsequent periods of native life emerged until the 17th century. New France set up small settlements, and in 1803 Napoleonic France sold the area to the U.S. as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Statehood for Missouri came following a compromise in 1820 that allowed slavery.\n\n[10]. The first two counties, Des Moines County and Dubuque County, were created in 1834 when Iowa was still part of the Michigan Territory. In preparation for Michigan's statehood, part of Michigan Territory was formed into Wisconsin Territory in 1836.[1] Two years later, the western portion was split off to become Iowa Territory.\n\n\n\nProvide your brief reasoning process first, then output final scores in JSON format like below, with document IDs as string keys and integer scores as values for all 10 documents.\nThe reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <reason> </reason> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., \n<reason>\n[Analyze each document's usefulness and relevance to the query, explaining your scoring rationale]\n</reason>\n<answer> \n```json\n{\"[1]\": 5, \"[2]\": 3, \"[3]\": 8}\n``` \n</answer>.\n", "output": "<reason>\nThe user's query asks for the specific date or year when Michigan became part of the United States as a state.

Most Anura [ 1 ] [ a ] (tailless amphibians), some reptiles, birds, and sharks , and some mammals (such as cats , beavers , polar bears , seals and aardvarks ) have full nictitating membranes; in many other mammals , a small, vestigial portion of the nictitating membrane remains in the corner of the eye. It is often informally called a third eyelid or haw ; the scientific terms for it are the plica semilunaris , membrana nictitans , or palpebra tertia .\n\n[2]. The plica semilunaris is a small fold of bulbar conjunctiva on the medial canthus of the eye . It functions during movement of the eye, to help maintain tear drainage via the lacrimal lake , and to permit greater rotation of the globe , for without the plica the conjunctiva would attach directly to the eyeball, restricting movement. [ 1 ] It is the vestigial remnant of the nictitating membrane (the \"third eyelid\") which is drawn across the eye for protection, and is present in other animals such as birds , reptiles , and fish , but is rare in mammals , mainly found in monotremes and marsupials . [ 2 ] Its associated muscles are also vestigial. [ 3 ] It is loose, thus eye movements are not restricted by it. Only one species of primate , the Calabar angwantibo , is known to have a functioning nictitating membrane. [ 4 ]\n\n[3]. Una de las principales acciones en el cuidado y limpieza del plumaje de las aves es el baño. Las aves pueden bañarse en agua, nieve, polvo e incluso hormigas. Está más raramente descrito el baño con hojas, en el que las aves aprovechan las gotas de agua acumuladas en las hojas para bañarse. Aquí describimos cuatro observaciones de cotorras de Kramer Psittacula krameri, realizadas en 2017 y 2021, en las que aprovechan las gotas de agua acumuladas en las hojas durante la lluvia para bañarse. Durante los últimos veinte años hemos observado con mucha frecuencia a las cotorras de pecho gris Myiopsitta monachus bañarse en los charcos, pero nunca las hemos visto bañarse con hojas. Se sabe que la cotorra de Kramer es muy reacia a bajar al suelo, lo que contrasta con la cotorra de pecho gris que busca muy a menudo alimento en el mismo. Por lo tanto, interpretamos que este baño con hojas podría ser una estrategia antipredatoria de la cotorra de Kramer que le evitaría bajar al suelo.\n\n[4]. “There wouldn’t have been a sluggish T. rex waiting for prey to walk by; we should think of them as active, curious animals.” Professor Roger Benson Archaeopteryx is considered a transitional species closest to the origin of birds Why were birds the only dinosaurs that survived the mass extinction at the end of Cretaceous? We know from the fossil record that large-bodied land animals were hit hard. Only the tiny survived. The smallest dinosaurs weighed about 500 g, but to survive as a land mammal you needed to weigh less than 50 g, and even then the chances were very slim. Lots of bird groups also went extinct. All sorts of reasons have been suggested – such as being a seed-eater or fish-eater (after the 10-km diameter meteor struck, there was a lack of sunlight due to dust, and freshwater ecosystems were a refuge). Some places would have been less terrible than others – clearly proximity to the impact zone in Mexico would have been terrible – but there were global effects. Will only small animals survive the current sixth mass extinction and the bird declines BirdLife scientists are monitoring today? We know from the fossil record that mass extinctions happen, but each one has a different cause and pattern. So we can’t predict what will happen next based on past mass extinctions. It’s much better to look at what’s happening to birds and other animals right now. The extinction of the dinosaurs is the most abrupt – it could have happened in a single year. The current mass extinction seems a lot faster than some of the other mass extinction events, though, in terms of rate of decline of abundance and rate of species loss. It’s terrifying, but only if it continues. And we have some control of this if people take action. The other lesson from mass extinctions is that the biosphere will recover. But not in our lifetimes – only on timescales that aren’t useful for human society. Some of our best fossil record studies monitor extinctions with data points every 100,000 years … So today, monitoring birds is one of the most important things we can do to catch species before they’re unknowingly lost. Favourite bird? I really like the Inaccessible Island Rail, the smallest flightless bird, living precariously on a tiny island. How can it be so small? It’s got something to tell us about evolution. No dinosaur had ever been that small. Islands are fascinating for an evolutionary biologist and we can’t risk losing this information from science, the sum of human knowledge. That’s just one reason why BirdLife’s work to protect island birds from introduced species is so important. Given your expertise, how do you feel when you look at birds today? I like watching them because I like animals and birds are some of the most visible. You can say that a pigeon’s foot is similar to a dinosaur’s – birds have inherited so much from dinosaurs but are also so distinctive in their own right. I respect that and see them doing something\n\n[5]. L ike mammals, the young of some birds are fed on special secretions from a parent. Unlike mammals, however, both sexes produce it. The best known of these secretions is the \"crop milk\" that pigeons feed to squabs. The milk is produced by a sloughing of fluid-filled cells from the lining of the crop, a thin-walled, sac-like food-storage chamber that projects outward from the bottom of the esophagus. Crops are presumably a device for permitting birds to gather and store food rapidly, minimizing the time that they are exposed to predators. Crops tend to be especially well developed in pigeons and game birds.\n\n[6]. Birds can actively control their nictitating membrane. [ 10 ] In birds of prey, the membrane also serves to protect the parents' eyes from their chicks while they are feeding them, and when peregrine falcons go into their 200-mile-per-hour (320 km/h) dives, they will blink repeatedly with their nictitating membranes to clear debris and spread moisture across the eyes. Woodpeckers tighten their nictitating membrane a millisecond prior to their beak impacting the trunk of a tree to prevent shaking-induced retinal injury. [ 11 ]\n\n[7]. PVD can cause several symptoms: Floaters for the first time or more floaters than you had before. The new floaters are usually noticed suddenly. There may be lots of new floaters or commonly a large cobweb-like floater. Flashes of light in your vision, usually like brief streaks of light in your peripheral (side) vision. Blurred vision. As the process of a PVD can last some weeks to some months, your symptoms may be ongoing for this period. Generally, your floaters and the flashes of light will gradually calm down and become less obvious to you. You might be aware of your floaters in the long-term following a PVD, although they are generally not as noticeable as when they first began. As long as the symptoms are not worsening after your eyes have been checked and PVD is diagnosed, then they are not usually a cause for concern. If you’re worried about any symptoms that don’t go away, speak to your optometrist or ophthalmologist about it. Floaters Floaters are very common and many people have them, even if they don’t have PVD. They’re floating clumps of cells that form in your vitreous. You can see them because they cast shadows on your retina when light comes into your eye. These floaters do not harm your eye. Floaters can be different shapes and sizes – dots that can look like flies, threads, circles, clouds, spiders or cobwebs. You may notice that your floaters move around a lot, or they may not seem to move much at all. They tend to be more obvious on a sunny day or when looking at a bright computer screen or a white or lightly coloured background. You may only have a few floaters or you may have many of them. Floaters may appear quite suddenly, and they may be very frustrating or worrying to you. When they’re at their most intense, you might think that your floaters will always interfere with your vision, but for most people, they become less obvious over time. Floaters never leave the eye but become less noticeable as the vitreous settles down and your brain learns to ignore them. Flashes of light When your vitreous pulls away from your retina, your retina reacts to this stimulation by sending a signal to your brain. Your brain processes this signal as a small, short flash of light. You’ll often see more in dark or dim lighting as they will show up more against a darker background. These flashes of light won’t affect you for as long as floaters, and they will probably become a lot less frequent once the vitreous has fully come away from your retina.\n\n[8]. By Anna Mari K. Birds transporting their eggs is one of the significant behaviors that you will witness if you are a bird owner or enthusiast. However, this egg-moving behavior is influenced by various factors, such as nest quality and predation risk. In this article, I will overview bird egg-moving behavior, their different approaches to doing so, the concept of moving eggs, and the actual truth behind it. So, let’s delve into the bird’s egg-moving behavior. How Do Birds Move Their Eggs? Birds don’t have hands or fingers like humans, which will help them move their eggs. Nonetheless, they use their beaks or bills, feet, roll-on methods, and holding methods for moving eggs from nest to nest or within the nest. Different Ways of Birds’ Egg Movement Carrying eggs in bills Some bird species use their significant bills to carry their eggs to different locations, which are safer and more secure than their past residences. Various birds with large bills, like seabirds, carry multiple eggs simultaneously while moving those eggs. Carrying eggs in feet\n\n[9]. The nictitating membrane is a transparent or translucent third eyelid present in some animals that can be drawn across the eye for protection and to moisten it while maintaining vision. The term comes from the Latin word nictare , meaning \"to blink\". It is often called a third eyelid or haw , and may be referred to in scientific terminology as the plica semilunaris , membrana nictitans , or palpebra tertia . Unlike the upper and lower eyelids , the nictitating membrane moves horizontally across the eyeball.\n\n[10]. The husband left, I had to move and buy a new house and guess what? I took John with me, but this time John wasn't using the bait. In fact I was calling John every week for help with the roaches. My new house was new to me but really very old, and it had a lot of roaches. A week would not go by when I did not see one or two or .... more. It was so bad I could not get out of bed at night and turn on a light for fear of what I would see. I implored John to use his magic peanut butter but he just told me \"we don't do that anymore\".
